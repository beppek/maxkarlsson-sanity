This is the code for my personal site. It started out as a gatsby-sanity starter, but not much of that code is still left.

Like any developer, I'm opinionated about the code I work with, and even more so when it comes to my personal site. Originally I just wanted to get up and running quickly, so I used the starter. However, as is always the case when I've used a Gatsby starter, I found a lot of things I disliked about the code. Don't get me wrong, I got a lot of inspiration and ideas and learnt a thing or two from the implementation, I just didn't like the approach, and for my personal site I wanted to have my personal preferences for absolutely everything.

In my experience after starting about 511 Gatsby sites to use as my personal blog, if I don't like the code, I won't do any work on the site and soon it just fades away into that place on the internet where all the other projects developers have started and then forgotten about.

So this time I decided to do something about it. I tore through the code with sledgehammer and blowtorch, I rummaged through files, tore down functions and burnt every single `.css` file I could find. In the end I ended up with what can be found in the `./web` folder. I converted the whole site to TypeScript and replaced all the postcss with styled components. Thhe result is a site built with exactly the tech _I_ love and use, something I can continue to work on for a long time to come.
